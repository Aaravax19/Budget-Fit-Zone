    <p>Building a home gym doesn’t mean emptying your wallet. With the right planning and budget-friendly equipment, you can create an effective workout space right at home.</p>

    <h2>Start with the Basics</h2>
    <p>Focus on versatile items like resistance bands, dumbbells, and a yoga mat. These tools support multiple workouts like strength training, stretching, and cardio.</p>

    <h2>Buy Budget-Friendly Equipment</h2>
    <p>Look for brands known for quality at low prices, such as Boldfit resistance bands and Lifelong yoga mats. These products offer durability without the high price tag.</p>

    <h2>DIY and Space-Saving Ideas</h2>
    <p>Use household items for weights or create workout stations in your living room or balcony. Minimal space can still deliver maximum results.</p>

    <h2>Keep it Simple and Consistent</h2>
    <p>Remember, consistency matters more than fancy equipment. Focus on daily workouts using your budget gear to see results.</p>
